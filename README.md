# Movies-Trailer

## Introduction
This project was part of Udacity Python foundation course.
It involves building a simple backend for a movies trailer website.

## How to use
To get the project running, add the three Python files-
- <i>entertainment.py</i>
- <i>fresh_tomatoes.py</i>
- <i>movies.py</i>

into the same folder, and then run the <i>entertainment.py</i> file.

The class is defined in the <i>movies.py</i> file and the sample data for four movies is provided in the <i>entertainment.py</i> file. The fresh_tomatoes.py file contains the front end of the trailer website, also written inside python.

The comments in the <i>entertainment.py</i> file make it easier to add more movies in the future.

The <i>fresh_tomatoes.html</i> file in the repository is the sample result that was created using the Python files, as per the process mentioned above.
