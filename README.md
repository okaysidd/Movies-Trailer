# Movies-Trailer
This project was part of Udacity Python foundation course.
It involves building a simple backend for a movies trailer website.

To get the project running, add the three Python files-
1. entertainment.py
2. fresh_tomatoes.py
3. movies.py
into the same folder, and then run the entertainment.py file.
The class is defined in the movies.py file and the sample data for four movies is provided in the entertainment.py file. The fresh_tomatoes.py file contains the front end of the trailer website, also written inside python.

The comments in the entertainment.py file make it easier to add more movies in the future.

The fresh_tomatoes.html file in the repository is the sample result that was created using the Python files, as per the process mentioned above.
