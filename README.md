# Movies-Trailer

## Introduction
This project was part of Udacity Python foundation course.
It involves building a simple backend for a movies trailer website.

## Note
The Udacity project required, at the minimum, to save movies data once and create web page out of them.
<i>I took some time to introduce the data in JSON format, also giving user option to add more movies from a simple command line interface. </i>

## How to use
To get the project running, add the three Python files-
- <i>entertainment_json.py</i> OR <i>entertainment_udacity.py</i>
- <i>fresh_tomatoes.py</i> (updated with story line display)
- <i>movies.py</i>

into the same folder, and then run the <i>entertainment_json.py</i> / <i>entertainment_udacity.py</i>file.

The class is defined in the <i>movies.py</i> file and the sample data for four movies is provided in the <i>entertainment_udacity.py</i> file. The <i>entertainment_json.py</i> file read data from the <i>movies_details.json</i> file and converts the json text to readable format and creates the objects of the **Movies class**. The fresh_tomatoes.py file contains the front end of the trailer website, also written inside python.

<i>The story line data is now available through the **Story line** button below each movie poster, and opens a modal with the movie story</i>


The <i>fresh_tomatoes.html</i> file in the repository is the sample result that was created using the Python files, as per the process mentioned above.
